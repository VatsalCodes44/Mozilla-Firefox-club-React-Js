I  built a simple yet functional website for the Mozilla Firefox Club using React.js and React Router DOM. This project showcases my growing expertise in web development, particularly in creating seamless navigation and structured layouts.


### Key Features & Technologies:

- **Built with React.js** for a dynamic and efficient user experience.

- **React Router DOM** is used for smooth navigation across different pages.

-   A **consistent navbar** that appears across all routes, providing easy access to:

 -  - **VIT Logo** – Represents the identity of our college.

- - **Home** – The landing page with a carousel..

- - **Events** – A section showcasing information about events.

- - **About Us** – Information about the club’s mission and vision.

- - **Community** – A space for members to connect and engage.

While keeping things simple, I incorporated key element that provide value to visitors.

### Carousel for Visual Appeal

A **carousel component** is featured on the home page, making it more dynamic and engaging. It could display:

● Highlights of past and upcoming **club events**

● Announcements or important **Mozilla initiatives**

● Inspirational quotes or fun facts related to **open-source contributions**
